# Grunty AI Multi-Provider Debugging Report

## Issue Summary
The Grunty AI application was experiencing problems with its multi-provider support, particularly when switching between Anthropic and OpenAI providers. The issues included:

1. Error handling during provider switching
2. Lack of proper error feedback to users
3. Initialization issues with the OpenAI provider
4. Missing log functionality in the UI

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
- Added detailed logging throughout the application with file names and line numbers
- Added console logging for immediate feedback during development
- Added stack trace logging for better debugging
- Improved log formatting for better readability

### 2. Improved Provider Initialization
- Added proper initialization checks in the OpenAI provider
- Added verification of API key availability
- Added API test call during initialization to verify connectivity
- Better error handling during provider creation and initialization

### 3. Enhanced Provider Switching
- Added more robust provider switching logic in the store
- Only recreate provider instances when necessary
- Proper error handling and recovery during provider switching
- Added user feedback through error dialogs when provider switching fails

### 4. OpenAI Provider Improvements
- Implemented proper computer control support
- Fixed message handling for the OpenAI API responses
- Added robust error handling for tool calls
- Improved response handling for different message formats

### 5. UI Improvements
- Added missing log method to MainWindow class
- Improved error message display in the UI
- Added better user feedback during provider operations

### 6. Dependency Management
- Better handling of optional dependencies
- Clear error messages when required packages are missing
- Graceful degradation when non-essential packages are unavailable

## Configuration
The application requires proper configuration in a `.env` file:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
DEFAULT_AI_PROVIDER=anthropic
```

## Testing

A new test script `test_providers.py` has been created to validate the provider functionality independently of the main application. This script tests:
- Anthropic provider creation and initialization
- OpenAI provider creation and initialization
- Provider manager functionality

All tests are passing, confirming that both providers are working correctly.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Add more specific error checks for different API errors
2. **Provider Configuration UI**: Add a dedicated settings page for provider configuration
3. **API Key Management**: Implement secure storage and management of API keys
4. **Automated Testing**: Expand the test coverage to include more complex scenarios
5. **New Providers**: Create a template for adding new AI providers easily

## Conclusion

The multi-provider support in Grunty AI is now working correctly. Users can switch between Anthropic and OpenAI providers with proper error handling and feedback. The application is more robust and user-friendly.
